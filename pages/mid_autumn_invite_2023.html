        <b>What is the Mid-Autumn Festival?</b> The Mid-Autumn Festival, or the Mooncake Festival, is a Chinese holiday celebrated with friends and family, though it is also celebrated in other asian countries. It changes daysevery year because it is based on the Lunar calendar. There are two main stories surrounding the Mid-Autumn Festival, including the Legend of Change'E and the origin of the mooncake.
    </p>
    <p>There will be some paper activities and a movie ("Over the Moon" starring Philipa Soo) for everyone to enjoy as a break from talking and snacks, which include water and a variety of Chinese teas, as well as some rice noodles and fried rice. Mooncake will of course be provided for dessert. <b>If you have any dietary or allergy restrictions (we do have a cat), please let us know ASAP.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>So bring your family and kids, and a dish to share. It does not have to be Chinese or asian in origin, just something you enjoy making or like sharing</b></p>
