            <p>Music has been a long-standing pillar in my life that I cannot break away from. Even though my career is in engineering, the beauty and majesty of music always draws me back.</p>

        <h3>Music as an Adult</h3>
        <p>Currently I teach beginner piano lessons at my residence, and I will teach anyone willing to learn: young, old, brand new, or has starting knowledge. I understand how beneficial music education is, and am also aware that many schools are doing away with it. In response to that, my lessons are very cheap to ensure that anyone can have access to a musical education. If you'd like to inquire more, please see the information on  <a href="contact_me.html">'Contact Me'</a>.</p>
